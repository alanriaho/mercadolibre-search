To run the project in development mode, first make sure you have a recent version of [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). By the moment I'm writing this, I have npm version 8.5.0 installed. Open the command line and type:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## About the project

#### Class naming
This project uses [BEM convention](https://webflow.com/blog/class-naming-101-bem) for naming components/elements so they're easy to maintain. This is in pro of scalability.

#### Accessibility
Every major section of the app is wrapped by an HTML semantic tag to improve accessibility. This is also good for SEO.

#### Mobile first, of course
Not much to type here... just so you know I used mobile first approach :D
